# WHY CHECK DISK CONSOLE #

**Microsoft DOS is Command-line interface (CLI).**

**Which is not used by users as many of us are interested to work on the Graphical User Interface (GUI) which is easy to use.**

**Many times users are not aware of the commands used on system or its working.**

**CHECK DISK CONSOLE is also Console based application which is interactive as it take input from user about drive to be checked and fixed.**
