**Save your all work and REBOOT your system , Now it will perform DISK CHECK at system reboot.**

**C Drive of system is always in use so this question is asked by console as Chkdsk required to DISMOUNT the drive for checking.**

**[This usually happens with C Drive ](.md) .**


# DISMOUNTING #

**DISMOUNTING means removing disk connected to system , It will dismount the drive for checking and connect it back after checking.**

**In case if consoe asked you ; Chkdsk cannot run because the volume is in use by another process. Chkdsk may run if this volume is dismounted first.
