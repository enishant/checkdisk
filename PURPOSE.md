# BAD SECTORS #
**A bad sector is a sector on a drive which cannot be used.**

**It is permanent damage or physical damage to the disk surface or failed flash memory transistors.**

**It is usually detected by a disk utility software such as CHKDSK on Microsoft systems OR badblocks on Unix-like systems.**

# ISSUE #

**This is because of the BAD sectors exists on those drives .**

**And this data is lost permanently as it was never recovered or restord back.**
